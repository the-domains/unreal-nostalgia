# Only one Truth

There's only one truth that rings across the universe, but it is our perception of that truth that defines us. Your feelings are influenced by the perception, which dictates your actions, and your beliefs about life, loves, and happiness. Are you willing to admit that what you believe isn't the truth? Can you fathom that you might be looking at the wrong side of something, making it ore or less important than it is? The truth exists, but we have to be open to the reality that we might not know it.
